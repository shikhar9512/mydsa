when a fn cals itself
big/complex problem soln depends on simiar type of small problem
for eg in 2^n
2^5=2*2^4
for eg 6!=6*5!
n!=n*(n-1)!

Base Case
jaha pe ruk jana ho ,eg 0! and 2^1
so we basically need 
1. a base Case(IT IS MANDATORY TOWRITE RETURN IN BASE CASE)
2. a recursive relation
3. processing part ( printing sth.,updating sth)
TAIL RECURSION

funcion(){
    base Case
    processing
    recursive relation
}

HEAD RECURSION

funcion(){
    base Case
    recursive relation
    processing
}
